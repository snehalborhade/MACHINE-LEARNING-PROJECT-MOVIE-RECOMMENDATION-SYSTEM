# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT-MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

*OVERVIEW*

A Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that suggests movies to users based on their interests, preferences, or past behavior. With the rise of streaming platforms, recommendation systems have become essential for improving user experience and increasing user engagement.

This project focuses on building a content-based recommendation system that analyzes the characteristics of movies — such as genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overviews — to suggest similar movies. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful features from textual data and applies cosine similarity to measure the similarity between movies.

By taking a movie title as input, the system recommends a list of top 5 similar movies using their content-based features. The model is built using Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and NLTK, and is trained on publicly available datasets such as those from Kaggle (TMDB Movie Metadata).

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in personalization and has practical applications in real-world platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and IMDb.



*WORKFLOW OF MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM*


Step 1: Data Collection
Datasets like TMDB or MovieLens.

Typical columns: title, overview, genres, cast, crew, keywords.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Combine relevant features into a single text field (tags).

Convert JSON-like columns into plain text (e.g., actor names, director).

Remove stopwords, lowercase, stemming, etc.

Step 3: Vectorization
Convert text into numerical format using:

CountVectorizer (bag-of-words)

TfidfVectorizer (for term importance)

Step 4: Similarity Calculation
Use cosine similarity to measure how close two movies are based on their vector representation.

Create a similarity matrix from the vectors.

Step 5: Recommendation Function
Given a movie title, find its index.

Retrieve similarity scores from the matrix.

Sort and return top N most similar movies.
